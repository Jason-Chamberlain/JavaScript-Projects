## **Basic JavaScript Projects** 

#### **Project1_expressions_alert**

    This project covered a range of fundamental programming concepts in JavaScript. 
    Understanding these key topics is crucial for building a strong foundation in JavaScript 
    programming and developing code that is readable, interactive, and well-documented. 

    The following key topics were discussed: 
        - Variables
        - Statements
        - Expressions
        - Alert Boxes
        - Escape Characters 
        - Concatenation
        - Comments

#### **Project2_functions**

    This project provided an explanation of the basic ideas of functions in JavaScript, 
    covering their syntax, purpose, and how they are used to encapsulate reusable blocks 
    of code. Understanding the fundamentals of functions is essential for writing modular 
    and organized JavaScript code that canbe executed repeatedly for different inputs. 

    The following key topics were discussed: 
        - Buttons
        - Function calls
        - Events
        - Event Handlers

#### **Project3_math_operators**

     This project introduced the basic concepts of math operators in JavaScript, explaining 
     their syntax and usage for performing mathematical calculations in code. Understanding 
     these concepts and their semantics is essential for manipulating numbers and executing 
     mathematical operations effectively in JavaScript programming.

    The following key topics were discussed: 
        - Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division operators
        - Multiple Operators 
        - Operator Precedence
        - Modulus Operator
        - Unary Operators (Positive, Negative, Increment, Decrement)
        - Random Numbers
        - Math Object, Math Constants, Math Methods

#### **Project4_dictionaries**

    This project explained the semantics of JavaScript dictionaries, providing an explanation 
    of their syntax and usage for organizing and retrieving key-value pairs. Understanding 
    the semantics of JavaScript dictionaries is crucial for efficiently managing and 
    accessing data in a structured manner within JavaScript programming. 

    The following key topics were discussed: 
        - Key Value Pairs (KVP)
        - delete Operator

#### **Project5_comparisons_type_coercion**

    This project provided an explanation of the semantics of types in JavaScript, including 
    discussions on type coercion and comparisons. Understanding the semantics of types, 
    type coercion, and comparisons is essential for handling data and performing accurate 
    comparisons in JavaScript programming.

    The following key topics were discussed:
        - typeof Operator
        - Type Coercion
        - Floating Point, NaN, Infinity, -Infinity
        - isNaN() Function
        - Boolean Logic
        - console.log() Method
        - Double Equal Signs, Triple Equal Signs
        - Logical Operators, And Operator, Not Operator

#### **Project6_ternary_operators_contructors**

    This project provided an explanation of the semantics of ternary operators, keywords, 
    and class constructors in JavaScript, covering their usage and behavior. Understanding 
    the semantics of these language elements is important for writing concise and efficient 
    code that makes use of conditional expressions, language-specific keywords, and 
    object-oriented programming principles in JavaScript.

    The following key topics were discussed:
        - ? Operator
        - this Keyword, new Keyword
        - Constructors
        - Reserved Words
        - Identifiers and Literals
        - Nested Functions

#### **Project7_scope_time_function**

    This project provided an explanation of the semantics of scope and conditional statements 
    in JavaScript, covering their usage and how they control the flow of code execution. 
    Additionally, it explored the usage of the Date object, explaining its purpose and 
    demonstrating how it can be utilized to work with dates and times in JavaScript.

    The following key topics were discussed:
        - Local and Global Variables
        - if Statements
        - else Statements
        - else if Statements
        - Date().gethours() Method
        
#### **Project8_string_number_methods**

    This project provided an explanation of the semantics of string and number methods in 
    JavaScript, covering their usage and how they can be applied to manipulate and perform 
    operations on strings and numbers. Understanding the semantics of these methods is crucial 
    for effectively working with string and number data in JavaScript programming.  
    
    The following key topics were discussed:
        - concat() Method
        - slice() Method
        - toUpperCase() Method
        - search() Method
        - toString() Method
        - toPrecision() Method
        - toFixed() Method
        - valueOf() Method

#### **Project9_countdown_slideshow**

    This project discussed the use of the countdown() function in JavaScript, enabling developers to implement countdown timers for various applications, such as event countdowns or time-limited activities. Additionally, it covered how to build a basic slideshow using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which can be used to showcase images or content in an interactive and visually appealing manner on webpages.
